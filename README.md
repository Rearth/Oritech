## About The Project


An upcoming tech mod for minecraft fabric. Features advanced ore processing, powered tools and armor, and much much more.

Currently in very early access, numerous bugs and issues are to be expected.

If you want to contribute, suggest ideas or just see what's planned, make sure to check out the GitHub discussions for this project (https://github.com/Rearth/Oritech/discussions).

Includes REI and EMI compatibility.

Forge-compatible with sinytra connector on 1.21.

Extra mod compatibilities (allowing metals and other components to be processed in Oritech machines, and vice-versa) for the following mode are included:
- Alloy Forgery
- Tech Reborn
- Energized Power

The following translations are available:
- English
- Chinese (by PlatinumOak)
- Brazilian Portuguese (by RenanEuzebio)

## Built With

- Fabric API
- Owo lib (for all the GUIs, config, and much more)
- Geckolib (for the animations)
- Lavender (for the guide book)
- Blockbench (to create and animate the models)

## Installation

Install it just like any mod by dragging it into the mods folder. Make sure you have the following dependencies installed (newer version might work too):

- Minecraft Version: fabric-1.21
- Fabric loader 0.15.9
- Fabric api 0.97.0+1.20.4
- Owo lib 0.12.6+1.20.3
- Lavender 0.1.7+1.20.3
- Geckolib 1.20.4:4.4.4
- Reborn Energy API 3.0.0
- Athena 4.0.0 (important: If you have sodium installed, Athena, and in turn Oritech, will break without indium)

## Credits

This mod is heavily inspired by the original techarium mod, which sadly never got finished. A lot of the machine names and models
were taken or strongly inspired by techarium. Huge thanks to the original techarium devs (YCar and Gecko and everyone else involved) for creating
the assets and ideas, and also for making them available under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 DEED](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license.

Some blocks and item textures are also from malcolmriley's unused-textures repository. Huge thanks to him for making those available as well (under the [CC BY 4.0 DEED](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license).

In detail, these are the following items that are from the above-mentioned sources:
* From [ArtOfTecharium](https://github.com/Ycarx/artoftecharium) (animations and textures were slightly modified, e.g. addon ports added, etc.)
  * Assembler Model
  * Foundry Model
  * Laser Arm Model
  * Powered Furnace Model
  * Energy Acceptor Model
  * Machine Extender Texture
  * Exosuit Model
  * Deep Drill Model
  * Ceiling Lights
  * Tech Door, Lever, Button
  * Machine Platings
  * Metal Beam
* From [malcolmriley's unused-textures repo](https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-textures)
  * Oil fluid textures (the dark gas texture)
  * The withered crop textures
  * Most of the crafting component textures
