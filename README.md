## Credits

This mod is heavily inspired by the original techarium mod, which sadly never got finished. A lot of the machine names and models
were taken or strongly inspired by techarium. Huge thanks to the original techarium devs (YCar and Gecko and everyone else involved) for creating
the assets and ideas, and also for making them available under the [CC BY-NC 4.0 DEED](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) license.

Some blocks and item textures are also from malcolmriley's unused-textures repository. Huge thanks to him for making those available as well (under the [CC BY 4.0 DEED](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) license).

In detail, these are the following items that are from the above-mentioned sources:
* From [ArtOfTecharium](https://github.com/Ycarx/artoftecharium) (animations and textures were slightly modified, e.g. addon ports added, etc.)
  * Assembler Model
  * Foundry Model
  * Laser Arm Model
  * Powered Furnace Model
  * Energy Acceptor Model
  * Machine Extender Texture
  * Exosuit Model
  * Deep Drill Model
  * Ceiling Lights
  * Tech Door, Lever, Button
* From [malcolmriley's unused-textures repo](https://github.com/malcolmriley/unused-textures)
  * Oil fluid textures (the dark gas texture)
  * Most of the crafting component textures

## Acknowledgements

* glisco, the creator of owo-lib, for creating this awesome library and supporting in its usage
* The creators and maintainers of Geckolib for creating the great animation engine, and helping out in their discord
* [LyFl0w's texture maker](https://github.com/LyFl0w/TextureMaker), which has been used for a lot of the other mod textures
