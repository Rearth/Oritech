When powered by {gold}RF{}, the tree cutter will cut down an entire tree including the leaves. The tree cutter will only cut logs up to 7 blocks away, so it may not reach the top of large trees.

;;;;;

The logs, leaves, and drops from the leaves will be stored in the tree cutter's internal inventory.
