The fragment forge is your first stop in turning ores into ingots.

Fragmenting ore blocks creates raw ores, and fragmenting raw ores creates ore dusts.

When fragmenting ore blocks and raw ores, the fragment forge will output more that it is given. Sometimes it will even give additional ores of a different type.

;;;;;

Most [addons](^oritech:processing/addons) affect the operation of the fragment forge. The machine yield addon will cause the fragment forge to produce additional byproducts.
