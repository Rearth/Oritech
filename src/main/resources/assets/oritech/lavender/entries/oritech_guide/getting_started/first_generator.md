Build a [basic generator](^oritech:processing/generators).

<recipe;oritech:basic_generator_block_basicgen>

This won't generate nearly enough power, but it's enough to get you started.

;;;;;

When you need more power, build more generators or start looking at the other [generators](^oritech:processing/generators) that Oritech provides.
