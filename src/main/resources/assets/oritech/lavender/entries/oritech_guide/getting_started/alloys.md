You can make [steel](^oritech:resources/steel), [electrum](^oritech:resources/electrum), and [adamant](^oritech:resources/adamant) in a crafting table, but it wastes resources to do it that way.

As soon as you can, you will want to build a [pulverizer](^oritech:processing/pulverizer) and [foundry](^oritech:processing/foundry) so that you can make alloys more efficiently.
