A [fragment forge](^oritech:processing/fragment_forge) can improve the yield of ores. When you process ores in a fragment forge, they get broken up into clumps and small clumps.

9 small clumps can be crafted into a clump, and clumps can be processed in a [centrifuge](^oritech:processing/centrifuge) to turn them into dusts and small dusts which can be smelted in a furnace.

You can put raw ores into a fragment forge, but for some ores you will get better results if you mine them with a silk touch pickaxe and put the ore blocks into the forge.

Both the fragment forge and the centrifuge can also produce secondary ores. For example, processing [nickel](^oritech:resources/nickel) will give you nickel and can also give you some [platinum](^oritech:resources/platinum).
