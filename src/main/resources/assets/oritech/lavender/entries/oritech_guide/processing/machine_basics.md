All oritech machines require energy to operate.

The top side is item-input only, while the sides can be used to insert and extract. The bottom only allows item extraction.

;;;;;

The items contained in a machine will always be dropped when the machine is destroyed, while the energy and fluids contained will be lost. Machines can be broken using a pickaxe.
There's no need for a special wrench or anything similar.
