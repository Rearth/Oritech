The centrifuge separates and transforms items. It can be used to get ore dusts from ore clumps that come from a [fragment forge](^oritech:processing/fragment_forge), to spin coal dust into carbon fibre strands, or it can be used with a [fluid addon](^oritech:processing/addons) to process oil or wheat into plastic sheets.
