;;;;;

The bedrock extractor can mine ores from below bedrock at places where ore resource nodes are found. The multiblock machine can only operate when placed on resource nodes, and
must be powered using enderic lasers.

**Resource Nodes**

<block;oritech:resource_node_nickel>

Resource nodes are spawned naturally throughout the world. They appear in clusters just on top of the bedrock layer. There are resource nodes for all ore types 
in the overworld. They are usually covered by a small pocket of water or oil on top.

;;;;;

On the surface, the location of a resource node cluster can be identified by the occurrence of an ore boulder. The ore boulder also identifies the type of ores found in the cluster.

;;;;;

When in operation, the bedrock extractor will mine the ores directly below it (the whole 3x3 area). Each operation will randomly select one of the blocks below. Not all blocks have to be
ore nodes.
