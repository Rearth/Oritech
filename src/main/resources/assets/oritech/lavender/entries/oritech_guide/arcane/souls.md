When a mob or living entity dies, it releases a soul. If a block capable of collecting the soul is within range (16 blocks), the soul will be collected by that block.
This can be seen as a small soul flying towards the block.

It will always go towards the closest collecting block.


Souls can be collected by:
- An Arcane Catalyst
- a Spawner Controller
