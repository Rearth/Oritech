Ore boulders are found on the surface of the world. They're made out of deepslate and are rich in ores.

Remember where you found them! [Resource nodes](^oritech:resources/resource_node) can be found below ore boulders near bedrock, and are often covered by pockets of [crude oil](^oritech:resources/crude_oil) or water.

The ores in the ore boulder indicate which ores can be found in the resource node below.
