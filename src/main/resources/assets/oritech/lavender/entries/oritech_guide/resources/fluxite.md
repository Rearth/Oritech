Fluxite is an important component of the flux gate, which is required for building some of the more advanced machines. The best way to obtain fluxite is by mining an amethyst cluster with an [enderic easer](^oritech:interaction/enderic_laser).

Fluxite can also be found when processing [platinum](^oritech:resources/platinum) ores.
