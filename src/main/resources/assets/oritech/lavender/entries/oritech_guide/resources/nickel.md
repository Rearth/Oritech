One of the first resources you'll need to gather, nickel ores can be found in [ore boulders](^oritech:resources/ore_boulder) or underground. Similar to iron, it is found most often deep underground where deepslate starts appearing.

Nickel is used in several alloys and is used to make most machines and machine parts.

Processing raw nickel (or nickel ore!) in a [fragment forge](^oritech:processing/fragment_forge) is a great way to get some [platinum](^oritech:resources/platinum).
