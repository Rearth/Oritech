Enderic Compound is a strange but useful substance that can be obtained by crushing ender pearls in a [Pulverizer](^oritech:processing/pulverizer) or [Fragment Forge](^oritech:processing/fragment_forge), or by processing sculk in a [Centrifuge](^oritech:processing/centrifuge).

Enderic Compound can be used to make budding amethyst in an [Assembler](^oritech:processing/assembler), or to duplicate ores with an [Atomic Forge](^oritech:processing/atomic_forge).
