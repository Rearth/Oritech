Pockets of crude oil can be found in many places underground. They are also common near the surface in desert biomes where they can be seen gushing out from the ground.

Crude oil can be processed with a [centrifuge](^oritech:processing/centrifuge) (with [fluid addon](^oritech:processing/addons)) into plastic sheets or turbofuel.
