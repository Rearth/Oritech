Before you can make much progress, you'll need some [fluxite](^oritech:resources/fluxite). To get it, overload amethyst clusters with an [enderic laser](^oritech:interaction/enderic_laser).

Crafting an enderic laser will build on all of the previous steps. It takes a combination of alloys, assembled components, and even some items like [enderic compound](^oritech:resources/enderic_compound) and carbon fibre strands that are made with

;;;;;

 a [centrifuge](^oritech:processing/centrifuge) and [pulverizer](^oritech:processing/pulverizer).

With your new enderic laser, a [target designator](^oritech:tools/target_designator), and a [generator](^oritech:processing/generators), you're ready to make some fluxite.

;;;;;

You can get fluxite by mining amethyst clusters with an enderic laser. Use the target designator to aim the laser at an amethyst cluster. The budding amethysts will not be broken, but will instead be energized and made to grow budding amethysts faster.
