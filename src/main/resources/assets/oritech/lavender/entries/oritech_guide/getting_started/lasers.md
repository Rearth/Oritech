Now you need [fluxite](^oritech:resources/fluxite).

Build an [enderic laser](^oritech:interaction/enderic_laser) and [target designator](^oritech:tools/target_designator), then grab a generator and go find an amethyst geode.

You can get fluxite by mining amethyst clusters with the enderic laser. The budding amethysts will not be broken, but will instead be energized and made to grow budding amethysts faster.
